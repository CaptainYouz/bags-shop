# Aswat Project | Bags shop
This is the repository of my Aswat test project.<br/>
You can see a demo online, on : http://www.thelink.com
The website is reponsive, so you also can test it on your phone.
If you are located in Duba√Ø, try your city name to have a reduction ;)

If you have a local nginx server installed, you can add this simple configuration to it

If you have Python installed, you can launch a simple http server with this command:
